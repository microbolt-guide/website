# Desktop signing app

We install [Sparrow Wallet](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow) on a
computer and connect it to your Electrum server on your node for private bitcoin
on-chain transactions.

![Sparrow wallet](/img/bitcoin/desktop-signing-app/sparrow.webp)

## Introduction

Sparrow Wallet is an excellent software signing device to use with your
MicroBolt: it's reliable and transparently shows what it's doing under the hood.

You can also use the following alternatives instead of Sparrow Wallet, according
to your preferences and needs:

* **Electrum Wallet Desktop**: a well-established poweruser wallet
* **Specter Desktop**: a multisig-focused wallet (this wallet connects
directly to Bitcoin Core)
* **BitBoxApp**: wallet for users of BitBox hardware signing devices

We will connect Sparrow Wallet to our own Electrum server as it is the most
private option. For more information about the privacy and security trade-offs
of the various server connection options, read the following
[article](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html) by Craig Raw,
the author of the software.

![Sparrow stages](/img/bitcoin/desktop-signing-app/sparrow-stages.webp)

We will set up Sparrow to connect to the Electum server within your local
network. There is also an optional section that explains how to connect Sparrow
to the Electrum server using Tor for when you're on the move.

Sparrow also connects to a couple of external services to get the Bitcoin price
and communicate with the Whirlpool server during CoinJoin operations. By
default, it uses clearnet which leaks your computer IP address to these services
and degrade your privacy. However, Sparrow can also connect to them using a Tor
proxy. There is an optional section that explains how to set this proxy up.

## Installation

On your local computer, download, verify and install Sparrow Wallet.

* Using the instructions on [this page](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/download): 
  * Download the required version for your OS
  * Download the manifest and manifest signature files
  * Verify the release
  * Install Sparrow Wallet

## Connection

We now configure Sparrow to connect to your node within your local network.

### Launch Sparrow

* Launch Sparrow
* Read carefully the introductory messages and click on "Next" several times
* When you reach the "Connecting to a Private Electrum Server" message, click on
"Configure Server"

### Connect to Electrum server

* Click on the "Private Electrum" tab
* On the "URL" line, paste `nakamoto01`, `nakamoto01.local` or your node IP
(e.g., `192.168.X.Y`) in the first box and `50002` in the second box
* Enable SSL by clicking on the slider
* Click on "Test Connection". A green tick should appear on the button and you
should see something similar to the following output:

```output filename="output"
Connected to [...] on protocol version 1.4
[...]
```

![Sparrow connect to Electrum](/img/bitcoin/desktop-signing-app/sparrow-electrum-no-proxy.webp)

If there is a connection error message, try the following troubleshooting:

* Make sure that your computer is not connected to any "guest" WiFi network at
home. A "guest" WiFi network prevents the computer to connect to any other
devices on the local network, such as your node.
* If you have used Sparrow Wallet before on this computer, try to connect again
after deleting the existing certificates that are stored within the `certs`
folder:

<Tabs items={['windows', 'unix/linux']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
`%AppData%\Sparrow\certs`
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
`~/.sparrow/certs`
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Let's go back to the signing app and check that it is connected to our own
Electrum server.

* Close the server configuration window
* Check the icon in the bottom right corner of the window status icon
  * The icon should be a blue slider button and a mouse over should display

`Connected to ssl://nakamoto01:50002 at height [...]`

🎉 You're set! Sparrow is now configured to connect to your Electrum server from
within your local network.

<Callout type="info">
For maximal privacy, we highly recommend that you set up the Tor proxy when
using Sparrow within your local network over clearnet.
</Callout>

<FAQBox title="Remote connection over Tor">
If you want to use Sparrow outside your home network, when you're on the go, you
can use a connection over Tor.

{<h3>Server Tor address</h3>}

To connect via Tor to Electrum, the server must have a Tor hidden service
connection address. Make sure you have set up a Tor hidden service as explained
in the "Electrum server" guide.

If you've already set up the hidden service but lost the connection address,
you can obtain it again by running the following command on your node:

```sh copy
$SU cat /var/lib/tor/electrum/hostname
```

```output filename="output"
abcd...1234.onion
```

{<h3>Sparrow configuration</h3>}

* Open Sparrow
* Navigate to the server configuration page by hitting `<Ctrl><P>` or `<Cmd><,>`
on macOS, then click on "Server"
* Click on the "Private Electrum" tab. If you've already have an existing
clearnet connection, click on "Edit Existing Connection".
* On the "URL" line, paste your Tor hidden service connection address (e.g.
"abcd...1234.onion") in the first box and `50002` in the second box
* Enable SSL by clicking on the slider
* Click on "Test Connection". A green tick should appear on the button and you
should see something similar to the following output:

```output filename="output"
Connected to [...] on protocol version 1.4
[...]
```

![Sparrow connect to Electrum via Tor](/img/bitcoin/desktop-signing-app/sparrow-electrum-tor-no-proxy.webp)

🎉 You're set! Sparrow is now configured to connect to your node over Tor and
you can use it wherever you are.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Set up a Tor proxy for external services">
If a Tor proxy is configured in Sparrow, all external connections use Tor. This
includes rate fetching, coinjoin etc - even transaction broadcasting is then
done via external service (like blockstream.info) over Tor for additional
privacy. Where-ever possible, the onion URLs of these services are used.

Sparrow can be configured to use an internal (bundled) or external Tor proxy. To
use the internal proxy, an onion Electrum server URL must be specified, and the
'Use Proxy' toggle must be off. Therefore, the following section only applies if
you connect to your Electrum server using the local IP address within your local
network (e.g., `nakamoto01`, `nakamoto01.local` or `192.168.X.Y`). If you're
using a Tor onion address to connect to your node, then Sparrow is already using
the internal proxy and there is nothing else to be done!

If you're using a local connection, we recommend that you set up this external
Tor proxy as described below for maximal privacy.

{<h3>Preparations on your computer</h3>}

For Sparrow Wallet to connect to the external services via Tor, Tor has to be
running on your computer. You can run the Tor Browser and use port 9150 on
localhost or else run Tor as a background service and use port 9050.

Here, we'll use the Tor as a background service and port 9050 as it is easier
and simpler to set up.

<Tabs items={['windows', 'macOS', 'linux']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
To work around this, first, make sure Tor is installed and running on your
Windows. Run as admin:

<Callout type="warning">
First you need to install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
</Callout>

```sh copy
choco install tor
tor --service start
```

Check tor service are working

```sh copy
netstat -aon | findstr ":9050"
```

```output filename="output"
  TCP    127.0.0.1:9050         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       23656
```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
To work around this, first, make sure Tor is installed and running on your Mac:

<Callout type="warning">
First you need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
</Callout>

```sh copy
brew install tor && brew services start tor
```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
There are countless Linux distributions, but the instructions for some of the
most notable Linux families are:

* Alpine-based OS: `apk add tor` and `rc-service tor start`
* Gentoo-based OS: `emerge net-vpn/tor` and `rc-service tor start`
* openSUSE-based OS: `zypper install tor` and `systemctl start tor`
* RedHat-based OS: `yum install tor` and `systemctl start tor`
* Debian-based OS: `apt install tor` and `systemctl start tor`

Done
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

{<h3>Signing app configuration</h3>}

* Open Sparrow
* Navigate to the server configuration page by hitting `<Ctrl><P>` or `<Cmd><,>`
on macOS, then click on "Server"
* Click on the "Private Electrum" tab. If you've already have an existing
clearnet connection, click on "Edit Existing Connection".
* Enable the Tor proxy by clicking on the "Use proxy" slider
* On the "Proxy URL" line, paste `127.0.0.1` in the first box and either `9050`
in the second box.
* Click on "Test Connection". A green tick should appear on the button and you
should see something similar to the following output:

```output filename="output"
Connected to [...] on protocol version 1.4
[...]
```

![Tor daemon proxy usage](/img/bitcoin/desktop-signing-app/sparrow-tor-proxy.webp)

Now, let's go back to the signing app and check that the proxy is working
properly.

* Close the server configuration window
* Check the two icons in the bottom right corner of the signing app window
status icons
  * The first icon should be grey, not red; and a mouse hover should display
"External Tor proxy enabled"

🎉 You're set! Sparrow Wallet is now configured to use the Tor proxy when
fetching the Bitcoin price and when communicating with the Whirlpool server
during CoinJoins.
