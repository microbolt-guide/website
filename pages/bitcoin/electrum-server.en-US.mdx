## Bitcoin with signing devices

The best way to safely keep your bitcoin key pairs (meaning the best combination
of security and usability) is to use a signing device (like
[SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com),
[Passport](https://foundationdevices.com), 
[BitBox](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02), [Coldcard](https://coldcard.com),
[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io)) in
combination with your own Bitcoin node. This gives you security, privacy and
eliminates the need to trust a third party to verify transactions.

Bitcoin client on the MicroBolt itself is not meant to hold funds.

One possibility to use Bitcoin client with your Bitcoin signing devices is to
use an Electrum server as middleware. It imports data from Bitcoin client and
provides it to signing software supporting the Electrum protocol. Desktop
signing apps like [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com), the
[BitBoxApp](https://shiftcrypto.ch/app), [Electrum](https://electrum.org) or
[Specter Desktop](https://specter.solutions/desktop) that support signing
devices can then be used with your own sovereign Bitcoin node.

Choose your server, when you're done jump to the Desktop wallet section
