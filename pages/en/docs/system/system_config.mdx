# System configuration

You are now on the command line of your own Bitcoin node. Let's start with the
configuration.

## Defaults

This guide have no defaults in mind, you can choose whathever tools you want

<Callout type="info">
However, from Microbolt we recommend `EDITOR=vim` and `SU=doas`
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Define which **text editor**, **root privileges tool** and **compile flags** defaults you want

```sh
vi /etc/profile.d/defaults.sh
```

```sh copy filename="/etc/profile.d/defaults.sh"
# Text editor
export EDITOR=vim # or notepad,vi,neovim,emacs,nano,micro...
# Root privileges tool
export SU=doas # or sudo...
# Compile flags
export CC="clang"
export CXX="${CC}++"
export CFLAGS="-O3 -pipe -march=native -fPIE"
export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
export LDFLAGS="-pie -Wl,--as-needed"
export MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)"
# Environment variables
export CARGO_HOME="./.cargo"
export npm_config_cache="./npm-cache"
export npm_config_devdir="./.gyp"
export ROCKSDB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include
export ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib
export PROTOC=protoc-c
```

### Source the changes

```sh copy
. /etc/profile.d/defaults.sh
```

### Install

<Callout type="warning">
Your choice may need additional steps, it's your responsibility
</Callout>

```sh copy
apk add $EDITOR $SU
```

### Install other necessary tools

```sh copy
apk add logrotate
```
</Steps>

## Add the admin user

We will use the primary user `satoshi` instead of `root` to make this guide more
universal.

<Steps>
### Create a new user called `satoshi` with your `password [A]`

```sh copy
adduser satoshi
```

### Make this new user a superuser by adding it to the `wheel` user group

```sh copy
adduser satoshi wheel
```

### Allow members of the **wheel** group to use root privileges with `$SU`

<Tabs items={['doas', 'sudo']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
```sh copy
sed 's/# permit persist :wheel/permit persist keepenv :wheel/' /etc/doas.conf > _
mv -f _ /etc/doas.conf
```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
```sh copy
printf "%s\n" \
    "%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL" \
    "Defaults env_keep += \"*\"" \
    > /etc/sudoers.d/wheel
```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Log out

```sh copy
exit
```

### Log in with `satoshi` admin user

```sh copy
ssh satoshi@nakamoto01
```
</Steps>

## System update

<Callout type="info">
Do this regularly every few weeks/months for security-related updates.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Update the operating system and all installed software packages

```sh copy
$SU apk update
```

### Upgrade the Alpine Package Manager itself

```sh copy
$SU apk add --upgrade apk-tools
```

### Upgrade all installed packages

```sh copy
$SU apk upgrade --available
```
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
All services that have been upgraded need to be restarted, to begin using the
upgraded version

```sh copy
$SU rc-service <service> restart
```

If the kernel is upgraded, it's required to reboot to begin using the upgraded
version

```sh copy
sync && reboot
```
</Callout>

## Check drive performance

Performant unit storage is essential for your node.

Let's check if your drive works well as-is.

* Your disk should be detected as `/dev/<drive>`. Check if this is the case by
listing the names of connected block devices

```sh copy
blkid
```

* Install the software to measure the performance of your \<drive\>
```sh copy
$SU apk add hdparm
```

* Measure the speed of your drive
```sh copy
$SU hdparm -t --direct /dev/<drive>
```

```output filename="output"
/dev/sda:
 Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 690 MB in  3.00 seconds = 229.82 MB/sec
```

<Callout type="info">
If the measured speeds are more than 150 MB/sec, you're good
</Callout>
