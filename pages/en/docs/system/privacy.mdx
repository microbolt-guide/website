# Privacy

We configure Tor and I2P to run your node anonymously.

Running your own Bitcoin and Lightning node at home makes you a direct,
sovereign peer on the Bitcoin network. However, if not configured without
privacy in mind, it also tells the world that there is someone with Bitcoin at
that address.

We'll also make it easy to connect to your node from outside your home network
as an added benefit.

True, it's only your IP address that is revealed, but using services like
[iplocation.net](https://www.iplocation.net), your physical address can be
determined quite accurately. Especially with Lightning, your IP address would be
widely used. We need to make sure that you keep your privacy.

## Tor Project

We use Tor, a free software built by the
[Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org). It allows you to anonymize internet
traffic by routing it through a network of nodes, hiding your location and usage
profile.

It is called "Tor" for "The Onion Router": information is routed through many
hops and encrypted multiple times. Each node decrypts only the layer of
information addressed to it, learning only the previous and the next hop of the
whole route. The data package is peeled like an onion until it reaches the final
destination.

### Preparation

Create `tor` group and user

```sh copy
$SU addgroup -S tor
```

```sh copy
$SU adduser \
    -S \
    -D \
    -H \
    -h /dev/null \
    -s /sbin/nologin \
    -G tor \
    -g tor \
    tor
```

### Install

```sh copy
$SU apk add tor
```

### Tor configuration

Bitcoin client will communicate directly with the Tor daemon to route all
traffic through the Tor network. We need to enable Tor to accept instructions
through its control port, with the proper authentication.

* Edit the Tor configuration

```sh copy
$SU cp /etc/tor/torrc.sample /etc/tor/torrc
$SU $EDITOR /etc/tor/torrc
```

* Uncomment the following lines

```conf filename="/etc/tor/torrc" {4,8}
...
## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
ControlPort 9051
## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.
#HashedControlPassword 24:972860B76453A77B40CA2BB8C1A7982072093276A3D701AD685353
CookieAuthentication 1

############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###
...
```

* Add under `CookieAuthentication 1`

```conf copy filename="/etc/tor/torrc"
CookieAuthFile /var/lib/tor/control_auth_cookie
CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1
DataDirectoryGroupReadable 1
```

* Start Tor and add service to runlevel

```sh copy
$SU rc-service tor start
$SU rc-update add tor default
```

* Ensure that the Tor service is working and listening at the default ports
`9050` and `9051`

```sh copy
$SU netstat -lntup | grep LISTEN | grep tor
```

```output filename="output"
tcp      0     0 127.0.0.1:9051       0.0.0.0:*             LISTEN     3359/tor
tcp      0     0 127.0.0.1:9050       0.0.0.0:*             LISTEN     3359/tor
```

* Check the logs to see Tor in real time updates output logs. Exit with `Ctrl-C`

```sh copy
$SU tail -f /var/log/tor/notices.log
```

Not all network traffic is routed over the Tor network. But we now have the base
to configure sensitive applications to use it.

<FAQBox title="SSH through Tor">
If you want to log into your Microbolt with SSH when you're away, you can easily
do so by adding a Tor hidden service. This makes "calling home" very easy,
without the need to configure anything on your internet router.

{<h4>Server</h4>}

* Add the following lines in the "location hidden services" section, below
"`## This section is just for location-hidden services ##`" in the torrc file

<Callout type="warning">
It's interesting to put the same port as done on `dropbear`/`openssh`, default
`22`
</Callout>

```sh copy
$SU $EDITOR /etc/tor/torrc
```

```conf copy filename="/etc/tor/torrc" {5}
# Hidden Service SSH server
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh/
HiddenServiceVersion 3
HiddenServicePoWDefensesEnabled 1
HiddenServicePort 2222 127.0.0.1:2222
```

* Reload the Tor configuration to apply the configuration

```sh copy
$SU rc-service tor reload
```

* Get the SSH Onion address

```sh copy
$SU cat /var/lib/tor/ssh/hostname
```

```output filename="output"
abcdefg..............xyz.onion
```

* Save the Tor address in a secure location, e.g. your password manager

{<h4>Client</h4>}

You also need to have Tor installed on your regular computer where you start the
SSH connection. Usage of SSH over Tor differs by client and operating system.

<Tabs items={['windows', 'macOS', 'linux']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
Popular tools like `torify` or `torsocks` are not available on Windows, and
`torifier` are abandoned.

To work around this, first, make sure Tor is installed and running on your
Windows. Run as admin:

<Callout type="warning">
First you need to install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
</Callout>

```sh copy
choco install tor
choco install nmap --version=7.92.0.20220321
tor --service start
```

Check tor service are working

```sh copy
netstat -aon | findstr ":9050"
```

```output filename="output"
  TCP    127.0.0.1:9050         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       23656
```

You can SSH to your PC "out of the box" with the following proxy command:

```sh copy
ssh `
    -o "ProxyCommand ncat --proxy-type socks5 --proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p" `
    satoshi@abcdefg..............xyz.onion -p 2222
```

* For a more permanent solution, add these six lines below to your local SSH
config file. Choose any HOSTNICKNAME you want, save, and exit

```sh copy
notepad .ssh/config
```

```conf filename="~/.ssh/config"
Host HOSTNICKNAME
  Hostname abcdefg..............xyz.onion
  User satoshi
  Port 2222
  CheckHostIP no
  ProxyCommand ncat --proxy-type socks5 --proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
```

* Restart Tor

```sh copy
tor --service stop
tor --service start
```

* You should now be able to SSH to your PC with

```sh copy
ssh HOSTNICKNAME
```

    <Tabs.Tab>
Using `torify` or `torsocks` may not work due to Apple's
_System Integrity Protection (SIP)_ which will deny access to `/usr/bin/ssh`.

To work around this, first, make sure Tor is installed and running on your Mac:

<Callout type="warning">
First you need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
</Callout>

```sh copy
brew install tor && brew services start tor

    satoshi@abcdefg..............xyz.onion -p 2222
```

* For a more permanent solution, add these six lines below to your local SSH
config file. Choose any HOSTNICKNAME you want, save, and exit

```sh copy
vi .ssh/config

  User satoshi
  Port 2222
  CheckHostIP no
  ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -x localhost:9050 %h %p

    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
* Use `torify` or `torsocks`, both work similarly; just use whatever you have
available

```sh
torify ssh admin@abcdefg..............xyz.onion -p 2222

## I2P Project

[I2P](https://geti2p.net) is a universal anonymous network layer. All
communications over I2P are anonymous and end-to-end encrypted, participants
don't reveal their real IP addresses. I2P allows people from all around the
world to communicate and share information without restrictions.

I2P client is software used for building and using anonymous I2P networks. Such
networks are commonly used for anonymous peer-to-peer applications (filesharing,
cryptocurrencies) and anonymous client-server applications (websites, instant
messengers, chat-servers).

We are to use [i2pd](https://i2pd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (I2P Daemon), a
full-featured C++ implementation of the I2P client, as a Tor network complement.

### I2P installation

```sh copy
$SU apk add i2pd
```

* Start the i2p service and add to runlevel

```sh copy
$SU rc-service i2pd start
$SU rc-update add i2pd default
```
* Ensure that the i2pd service is working and listening at the default ports

```sh copy
$SU netstat -lntup | grep LISTEN | grep i2pd
```

```output filename="output"
tcp      0     0 127.0.0.1:4447       0.0.0.0:*             LISTEN     3571/i2pd

tcp      0     0 127.0.0.1:7070       0.0.0.0:*             LISTEN     3571/i2pd
```

* See `i2p` in action by monitoring its log file. Exit with `Ctrl-C`

```sh copy
$SU tail -f /var/log/i2pd/i2pd.log
