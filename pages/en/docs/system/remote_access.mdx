# Remote access

We connect to our personal computer by using `ssh` (Secure Shell).

## Enable the use of hostname to connect to the node

To be able to use the `nakamoto01` hostname instead of the IP address, we must
install this necessary software package

<Steps>
### Install `avahi`
 
```sh copy
apk add avahi
```
 
### Add service to runlevel

```sh copy
rc-update add avahi-daemon
```

### Start service

```sh copy
rc-service avahi-daemon start
```

### Log out

```sh copy
exit
```
</Steps>

## Access with Secure Shell

Now itâ€™s time to connect to the Microbolt via `ssh` and get to work.
