Now you're all set up for Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is not primarily designed for
fast and cheap payments. The blockchain that records all transactions cannot
grow without limit if we want to keep the whole system decentralized and nodes
like this Microbolt feasible.

Building on top of the Bitcoin base layer, the Lightning Network enables instant
and cheap everyday payments. Your coffee purchase doesn't necessarily need to be
validated and recorded by all Bitcoin nodes worldwide if you think about it.

Check out [Understanding the Lightning Network] from Bitcoin Magazine to learn
more about how it works.

To enable the Lightning Network on your Microbolt, we install a Lightning
Client. We then set up an automatic Static Channel Backup to protect ourselves
in case of failure of the SSD drives. We'll then add a web-based node management
tool. Finally, we'll install a mobile app to make on-chain and LN payments and
manage our node while we're on the go. Together, they make operating your node a
breeze.
