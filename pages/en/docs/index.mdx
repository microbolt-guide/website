# Microbolt

![Microbolt banner image](/img/microbolt-banner.webp)

Build your own ‚Äúdo-everything-yourself‚Äù Bitcoin full node that will make you a
sovereign peer in the Bitcoin and Lightning network.

No need to trust anyone else.

## What is the Microbolt?

Microbolt is more than a fork of [RaspiBolt](https://raspibolt.org) and
[MiniBolt](https://minibolt.info), made for all kind of computers, not only
Raspberry Pi's.

With this guide, you can set up a Bitcoin and Lightning node from scratch, doing
everything yourself. You will learn about Linux, Bitcoin, and Lightning. As a
result, you'll have your very own Microbolt node, built by you and no one else.

There are many reasons why you should run your own Bitcoin node.

* **Keep Bitcoin decentralized.** Use your node to help enforce your Bitcoin
consensus rules.
* **Take back your sovereignty.** Let your node validate your own Bitcoin
transactions. No need to ask someone else to tell you what's happening in the
Bitcoin network.
* **Improve your privacy.** Connect your wallets to your node so that you no
longer need to reveal their whole financial history to external servers.
* **Be part of Lightning.** Run your own Lightning node for everyday
payments and help building a robust, decentralized Bitcoin Lightning network.

Did we mention that it's fun, as well?

## Microbolt overview

This guide explains how to set up your own Bitcoin node on a Computer. But it
works on most hardware platforms because it only uses standard Alpine Linux
commands.

### Features

Your Bitcoin node will offer the following functionality:

üü† **Bitcoin**: direct and trustless participation in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer
network, full validation of blocks and transactions

‚öõÔ∏è **Electrum server**: connect your compatible wallets (including hardware
wallets) to your own node

‚õìÔ∏è **Blockchain Explorer**: web-based Explorer to privately look up
transactions, blocks, and more

‚ö° **Lightning**: full client with stable long-term channels and web-based and
mobile-based management interfaces

ü™Ω **Nostr**: global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media

üîã **Always on**: services are constantly synced and available 24/7

üßÖ **Reachable from anywhere**: connect to all your services through the Tor
network

### Target audience

We strive to give foolproof instructions. But the goal is also to do everything
ourselves. Shortcuts that involve trusting someone else are not allowed. This
makes this guide quite technical, but we try to make it as straightforward as
possible. You'll gain a basic understanding of the how and why.

If you like to learn about Linux, Bitcoin, and Lightning, then this guide is for
you.

### Structure

We aim to keep the core of this guide well maintained and up-to-date:

1. [System](./docs/system.md): prepare the hardware and set up the operating
system
1. [Bitcoin](./docs/bitcoin.md): sync your own Bitcoin full node, Electrum
server, and Blockchain Explorer
1. [Lightning](./docs/lightning.md): run your own Lightning client with
web-based node management
1. [Nostr](./docs/nostr.md): utilize decentralized and censorship-resistant
social networks
