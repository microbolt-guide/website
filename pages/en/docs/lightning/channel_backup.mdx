# Channel backup

We set up a local or remote "Static Channel Backup" for Lightning. A monitoring
script keeps it up-to-date to enable the recovery of your Lightning funds in
case of hardware failure.

![GitHub remote backup](/img/lightning/lnd/remote-scb-backup.webp)

## Why are Lightning channel backups important?

The Static Channels Backup (SCB) is a feature of LND that allows for the
on-chain recovery of lightning channel balances in the case of a bricked node.
Despite its name, it does not allow the recovery of your LN channels but
increases the chance that you'll recover all (or most) of your off-chain (local)
balances.

The SCB contains all the necessary channel information used for the recovery
process called Data Loss Protection (DLP). It is a safe backup mechanism with no
risk of provoking penalty transactions that could lead to losing channel
balances. The SCB contains all necessary peer and channel information, allowing
LND to send a request to force-close the channel on their end to all your
previous online peers. Without this method, you would need to contact your peers
manually or wait for them to force-close on their own eventually.

This SCB-based recovery method has several consequences worth bearing in mind:

* This method relies on the goodwill of the peer: a malicious peer could refuse
to force-close the channel, and the funds would remain locked up.

* Recovery only works with online peers: LND cannot send a request to
force-close the channel if a peer is offline. Therefore, the funds in that
channel will remain locked up until this peer comes back online, or possibly
forever if that peer doesn't come back.

* The backup needs to be up-to-date: Since LND needs to know about your peers
and channels, the SCB needs to be updated every time you open a new channel.

You need to set up an automated SCB update mechanism that:

* Creates or updates your SCB file each time you open a channel (or close one,
although this is less important)
* Stores the SCB file to a different backup location to ensure that it is
available in case of a failing SSD.

You can read more about SCBs in [this section of 'Mastering the Lighning
Network'](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/ec806916edd6f4d1b2f9da2fef08684f80acb671/05_node_operations.asciidoc#node-and-channel-backups).

## Choose your preferred backup method

This guide covers two automated backup methods:

* **LOCAL**: store the backup on a USB thumbdrive or microSD card plugged into
your computer
* **REMOTE**: send the encrypted backup to a private GitHub repository

|                     | LOCAL         | REMOTE                        |
| :------------------ | :-----------: | :---------------------------: |
| Requires hardware   | YES           | NO                            |
| Requires Github     | NO            | YES                           |
| Protects against    | Drive failure | Drive failure and node damage |
| Relies on 3rd party | NO            | YES                           |

We recommend to use both methods, but you can choose either one of them,
depending on your own requirements and preferences.

## Preparations

We prepare a shell script that automatically updates the LND SCB file on a
change in your backup location.

### Create script

We create a shell script to monitor `channel.backup` and make a copy to our
backup locations if it changes.

* Create a new shell script file

```sh copy
$SU $EDITOR /usr/bin/scbb
```

* Check the following lines of code and paste them into the text editor. By
default, both local and remote backup methods are disabled. We will enable one
or both of them in the next sections, depending on your preferences. Save and
exit.

```

* Make the script executable

```sh copy
$SU chmod +x /usr/bin/scbb
```

### Autostart on boot

We set up the backup script as a openrc service to run in the background and
start automatically on system startup.

* Create the init.d unit and copy/paste the following configuration. Save and
exit.

```sh copy
$SU $EDITOR /etc/init.d/scbb
```

```sh copy filename="/etc/init.d/scbb"
#!/sbin/openrc-run

: ${SCBB_BIN:=/usr/bin/scbb}
: ${SCBB_LOCAL=${SCBB_LOCAL}}
: ${SCBB_REMOTE=${SCBB_REMOTE}}
: ${SCBB_OPTS=${SCBB_OPTS}}

name="SCBB"
description="SCBB Backup daemon"

command="${SCBB_BIN}"
command_args="${SCBB_LOCAL}
              ${SCBB_REMOTE}
              ${SCBB_OPTS}"
command_user="lnd:lnd"
command_background="true"

pidfile="/run/${SVCNAME}.pid"

start_stop_daemon_args="--stdout-logger 'logger -t scbb[$$] -p daemon.info'
                        --stderr-logger 'logger -t scbb[$$] -p daemon.err'"

depend() {
    use lnd
    after lnd
}
```

* Enable execution permission

```sh copy
$SU chmod +x /etc/init.d/scbb
```

## Local backup

Follow this section if you want a local backup. If you only want a remote
backup, skip to the [next section](#remote-backup).

### Formatting

<Callout>
The `channel.backup` file is very small in size (< 1 MB) so even the smallest
USB thumbdrive or microSD card will do the job.
</Callout>

* Plug the storage device and find it

```sh copy
$SU fdisk -l
```

* Set environment variable to the device file

```sh
mydev=/dev/sdY #Usually /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc
```

* Partition the disk

```sh copy
fdisk "$mydev" <<EOF
o
n
p
1


t
0c
a
1
w
EOF
```

* Populate new created partitions

```sh copy
mdev -s
```

* Format partition

```sh copy
mkfs.vfat -F32 -n "SCB backup" "${mydev}1"
```

### Set up a mounting point for the storage device

* Create the mounting directory and make it immutable

```sh copy
$SU mkdir /mnt/scbb-local
$SU chattr +i /mnt/scbb-local
```

* List active block devices and copy the `UUID` of your backup device into a
text editor on your local computer (e.g. here `1234-5678`).

```sh copy
$SU blkid
```

```sh filename="output"
/dev/loop0: TYPE="squashfs"
/dev/loop/0: TYPE="squashfs"
/dev/sda1: UUID="b73b1dc9-6e12-4e68-9d06-1a1892663226" TYPE="xfs"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="6C12-4B68" TYPE="vfat"
/dev/sdc1: UUID="1234-5678" TYPE="vfat"
```

* Get the "lnd" user identifier (UID) and the "lnd" group identifier (GID) from
the `/etc/passwd` database of all user accounts. Copy these values into a text
editor on your local computer (e.g. here GID `XXXX` and UID `YYYY`)

```sh copy
awk -F ':' '$1=="lnd" {print "GID: "$3" / UID: "$4}' /etc/passwd
```

```sh filename="output"
GID: XXXX / UID: YYYY
```

* Edit your Filesystem Table configuration file and add the following as a new
line at the end, replacing `123456`, `XXXX` and `YYYY` with your own `UUID`,
`GID` and `UID`

```sh
printf "%s\n" \
    "UUID=1234-5678 /mnt/scbb-local vfat auto,noexec,nouser,rw,sync,nosuid,nodev,noatime,nodiratime,nofail,umask=022,gid=XXXX,uid=YYYY 0 0" \
    | $SU tee -a /etc/fstab
```

<Callout>
More: [fstab guide](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/fstab)
</Callout>

* Mount the drive and check the file system is “/mnt/scb-local”

```sh copy
$SU mount -a
```

```sh copy
$SU df -h /mnt/scbb-local
```

```sh filename="output"
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdc                  1.9G      4.0K      1.9G   1% /mnt/scbb-local
```

### Enable the local backup function in the script

* Enable the local backup in the init.d script by adding the variable value for
`SCBB_LOCAL`. Save and exit.

```sh copy
printf "%s\n" \
    "SCBB_LOCAL=\"--local /mnt/scbb-local\"" \
    | $SU tee -a /etc/conf.d/scbb
```

* Start the openrc service to activate the change

```sh copy
$SU rc-service scbb restart
```

* Check status

```sh copy
$SU rc-service scbb status
```

## Remote backup

Follow this section if you want a remote backup. If you already set up a local
backup, and don't want a remote backup, skip to the [next section](#test).

### Create a GitHub repository

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com), sign up for a new user account, or log in
with an existing one. If you don't want for GitHub to know your identity and IP
address in relation to your Lightning node, it is recommended to create new
account even if you have existing one, and use [Tor
Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download) for this and following steps.

* Create a new repository: https://github.com/new
* Type the following repository name: `remote-lnd-backup`
* Select "Private" (rather than the default "Public")
* Click on "Create repository"

### Clone the repository to your node

* Create a pair of SSH keys. When prompted, press "Enter" to confirm the default
SSH directory and not set up a password.

```sh copy
$SU apk add openssh torsocks
```

```sh copy
$SU -u lnd ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

```sh copy
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
[...]
```

* Display the public key

```sh copy
$SU -u lnd cat ~/.lnd/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

```sh filename="output"
ssh-rsa 1234abcd... lnd@nakamoto01
```

* Go back to the GitHub repository webpage
* Click on "Settings", then "Deploy keys", then "Add deploy key"
* Type a title (e.g., "scbb")
* In the "Key" box, copy/paste the string generated above starting (e.g.
`ssh-rsa 1234abcd... lnd@nakamoto01`)
* Tick the box "Allow write access" to enable this key to push changes to the
repository
* Click "Add key"

* Set up global Git configuration values (the name and email are required but
can be dummy values). Then, move to the LND data folder and clone your newly
created empty repository. Replace `doitwithnotepad` with your own GitHub
username. When prompted "Are you sure you want to continue connecting", type
`yes` and press "Enter".

```sh
(
    cd ~/.lnd
    $SU -u lnd sh -c '
        git config --global user.name "Microbolt"
        git config --global user.email "1@[23456789]"
        git config --global core.sshCommand "torsocks ssh"
        git clone git@github.com:doitwithnotepad/remote-lnd-backup.git
    '
)
```

```sh filename="output"
Cloning into 'remote-lnd-backup'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```

### Enable the remote backup function in the script

* Enable the remote backup in the init.d script by adding the variable value for
`SCBB_REMOTE`. Save and exit.

```sh copy
printf "%s\n" \
    "SCBB_REMOTE=\"--remote /var/lib/lnd/remote-lnd-backup\"" \
    | $SU tee -a /etc/conf.d/scbb
```

* Start the openrc service to activate the change

```sh copy
$SU rc-service scbb restart
```

* Check status

```sh copy
$SU rc-service scbb status
```

## Test

The automated backup is now up and running. To test if everything works, we now
cause the default `channel.backup` file to change. Then we check if a copy gets
stored at the intended backup location.

* Follow the system log entries for the SCB backup service in real-time

```sh copy
tail -f /var/log/messages | grep scbb
```

```sh filename="output"
[...]
Mar 12 13:28:35 nakamoto01 daemon.info scbb[22817]: Watches established.
```

* Simulate a `channel.backup` file change with the `touch` command (don't worry!
it simply updates the timestamp of the file but not its content).

```sh copy
$SU touch /var/lib/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup
```

* In the logs, you should see new entries similar to these (depending on which
backup methods you enabled):

```sh filename="output"
[...]

[...]
```

* If you enabled the local backup, check the content of your local storage
device. It should now contain a backup file with the date/time corresponding to
the test made just above

```sh copy
ls -lha /mnt/scbb-local
```

```sh filename="output"
[...]
-rwxr-xr-x    1 lnd      lnd           45 Mar 12 13:32 channel-20240312-133233.backup
[...]
```

* If you enabled the remote backup, check your GitHub repository. It should now
contain the latest timestamped backup file

🎉 You're set! Each time you open a new channel or close an existing one, the
monitoring script will automatically save a timestamped copy of the backup file
to your backup location.
