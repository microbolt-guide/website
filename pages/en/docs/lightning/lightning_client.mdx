# Lightning client

We set up [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd), the Lightning Network
Daemon by [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering).

## Preparations

<Steps>
### Create the `lnd` user/group

```sh copy
$SU addgroup -S lnd
```

```sh copy
$SU adduser \
    -S \
    -D \
    -H \
    -h /var/lib/lnd \
    -s /sbin/nologin \
    -G lnd \
    -g lnd \
    lnd
```

### Add `lnd` user to the `bitcoin` group

```sh copy
$SU adduser lnd bitcoin
```

### Add the user `satoshi` to the group `lnd` as well

```sh copy
$SU adduser satoshi lnd
```

### Add the user `lnd` to the group `tor`

This allow the user `lnd` to use the control port and configure Tor directly

```sh copy
$SU adduser lnd tor
```

### Create a symbolic link lnd to `satoshi` home

```sh copy
ln -s /var/lib/lnd "$HOME/.lnd"
```
</Steps>

## Installation

The installation of LND is straight-forward, but the application is quite
powerful and capable of things not explained here. Check out their [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) for a wealth of information
about their open-source project and Lightning in general.

<Steps>
### Download binaries

We'll download, verify and install LND.

* Download the application and the checksums file (.txt) with its signature
(.sig) and timestamp (.ots)

```sh copy
cd /tmp
```

```sh copy
VERSION=0.18.3-beta
```

```sh copy
curl -OL https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION/lnd-linux-amd64-v$VERSION.tar.gz \
     -OL https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION/manifest-v$VERSION.txt \
     -OL https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION/manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION.sig \
     -OL https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION/manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION.sig.ots \
     -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/sample-lnd.conf
```

### Checksum check

* Verify the signed checksum against the actual checksum of your download

```sh copy
grep lnd-linux-amd64-v$VERSION.tar.gz manifest-v$VERSION.txt | sha256sum -c
```

```output filename="output"
lnd-linux-amd64-v0.17.4-beta.tar.gz: OK
```

### Signature check

Now that we've verified the integrity of the downloaded binary, we need to check
the authenticity of the manifest file we just used, starting with its signature.

* Install `gnupg`

```sh copy
$SU apk add gnupg
```

* Get the public key from the LND developer who signed the manifest file; and
add it to your GPG keyring

```sh copy
curl -s \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/roasbeef.asc |\
    gpg --import
```

```output filename="output"
[...]
gpg: key 372CBD7633C61696: public key "Olaoluwa Osuntokun <laolu32@gmail.com>" imported
[...]
```

* Verify the signature of the text file containing the checksums for the
application

```sh copy
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION.sig manifest-v$VERSION.txt
```

```output filename="output"
gpg: Signature made Tue Feb  6 20:39:45 2024 CET
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from "Olaoluwa Osuntokun <laolu32@gmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: E4D8 5299 674B 2D31 FAA1  892E 372C BD76 33C6 1696
     Subkey fingerprint: 60A1 FA7D A5BF F08B DCBB  E790 3BBD 59E9 9B28 0306
```

### Timestamp check

We can also check that the manifest file was in existence around the time of the
release using its timestamp.

* Let's verify the timestamp of the file matches the release date.

```sh copy
ots --no-cache verify manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION.sig
```

```output filename="output"
[...]
Success! Bitcoin block 829257 attests existence as of 2024-02-06 CET
```

* Check that the date of the timestamp is close to the [release
date](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases) of the LND binary.

### Installation

Having verified the integrity and authenticity of the release binary, we can
safely proceed to install it!

* Install LND

```sh copy
$SU tar xzf lnd-linux-amd64-v$VERSION.tar.gz -C /usr/bin --strip-components=1
```

```sh copy
$SU install -D -m 0660 -o lnd -g lnd ./sample-lnd.conf /etc/lnd/lnd.conf
```

```sh copy
lnd --version
```

```output filename="output"
lnd version 0.17.4-beta commit=v0.17.4-beta
```
</Steps>

### Autostart on boot

Now, let's set up LND to start automatically on system startup.

* Create LND init.d unit with the following content. Save and exit.

```sh copy
$SU $EDITOR /etc/init.d/lnd
```

```sh copy filename="/etc/init.d/lnd"
#!/sbin/openrc-run

    checkconfig
}

start_post() {
    chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o= "${LND_DATADIR}" "${LND_LOGDIR}"
}

checkconfig() {
    if ! grep -qs '^bitcoind.rpccookie=' "${LND_CONFIGFILE}"
    then

        eerror "ERROR: You must set a bitcoind.rpccookie= path to run LND."
        eerror "The setting must appear in ${LND_CONFIGFILE}"
        eerror ""
        return 1
    fi
}
```

* Enable execution permission

```sh copy
$SU chmod +x /etc/init.d/lnd
```

## LND in action

### Wallet password

LND includes a Bitcoin wallet that manages your on-chain and Lightning coins.
It is password protected and must be unlocked when LND starts.
This creates the dilemma that you either manually unlock LND after each restart
of your computer, or you store the password somewhere on the node.

For this initial setup, we choose the easy route: we store the password in a
file that allows LND to unlock the wallet automatically.
This is not the most secure setup, but you can improve it later if you want.
To give some perspective: other Lightning implementations like c-lightning or
Eclair don't even have a password.

* Create a text file and enter your LND wallet `password [C]`. Save and exit.

```sh copy
$EDITOR /etc/lnd/passwd.txt
```

To improve the security of your wallet, check out these more advanced methods:

* Example by LND: [using a password manager with named
pipe](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/wallet.md#more-secure-example-with-password-manager-and-using-a-named-pipe)

### Enable and start LND

```sh copy
$SU rc-update add lnd
$SU rc-service lnd start

```

### Wallet setup

Once LND is started, the process waits for us to create the integrated Bitcoin
wallet.

* Create the LND wallet

```sh copy
lncli create
```

* Enter your `password [C]` as wallet password (it must be exactly the same you
stored in `passwd.txt`). To create a a new wallet, select `n` when asked if you
have an existing cipher seed. Just press enter if asked about an additional seed
passphrase, unless you know what you're doing. A new cipher seed consisting of
24 words is created.

```output filename="output"
Input wallet password:
Confirm password:
 
Do you have an existing cipher seed mnemonic or extended master root key you want to use?
Enter 'y' to use an existing cipher seed mnemonic, 'x' to use an extended master root key
or 'n' to create a new seed (Enter y/x/n): n
 
Your cipher seed can optionally be encrypted.
Input your passphrase if you wish to encrypt it (or press enter to proceed without a cipher seed passphrase):
 
Generating fresh cipher seed...
 
!!!YOU MUST WRITE DOWN THIS SEED TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE WALLET!!!

---------------BEGIN LND CIPHER SEED---------------

These 24 words is all that you need to restore the Bitcoin on-chain wallet. The
current state of your channels, however, cannot be recreated from this seed. For
this, the Static Channel Backup stored at
`/var/lib/lnd/data/chain/**/**/channel.backup` is updated continuously.

<Callout type="warning">
This information must be kept secret at all times.

* **Write these 24 words down manually on a piece of paper and store it in a
safe place.**

You can use a simple piece of paper, write them on the custom themed [SeedSigner
backup
card](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/blob/dev/docs/seed_qr/printable_templates/29x29_letter_trading_card_2sided.pdf),
or even [stamp the seed words into
metal](https://raspibolt.org/guide/bonus/bitcoin/safu-ninja.html).
This piece of paper is all an attacker needs to completely empty your on-chain
wallet!

Do not store it on a computer.

Do not take a picture with your mobile phone.

**This information should never be stored anywhere in digital form.**
</Callout>

### Restart LND

```sh copy
$SU rc-service lnd restart
```

* Check the log to see LND output. Exit with `Ctrl-C`

```sh copy
tail -f /var/log/lnd/**/**/lnd.log
```

🎉 Now your Lightning node is ready. This is also the point of no return. Up until
now, you can just start over. Once you send real bitcoin to your Microbolt, you
have "skin in the game".

<FAQBox title="Funding your Lightning node">
* Generate a new Bitcoin address (p2tr = taproot) to receive funds on-chain and
send a small amount of Bitcoin to it from any wallet of your choice.

[`newaddress`](https://api.lightning.community/api/lnd/lightning/new-address)

```sh copy
lncli newaddress p2tr
```

```output filename="example output"
{
    "address": "bc1...[REDACTED]..."
}
```

* Check your LND wallet balance

[`walletbalance`](https://api.lightning.community/api/lnd/lightning/wallet-balance)

```sh copy
lncli walletbalance
```

```output filename="example output"
{
    "total_balance": "0",
    "confirmed_balance": "0",
    "unconfirmed_balance": "0",
    "locked_balance": "0",
    "reserved_balance_anchor_chan": "0",
    "account_balance": {
        "default": {
            "confirmed_balance": "0",
            "unconfirmed_balance": "0"
        }
    }
}
```

As soon as your funding transaction is mined (1 confirmation), LND will show its
amount as "confirmed_balance".

<Callout>
If you want to open a few channels, you might want to send a few transactions.
If you have only one UTXO, you need to wait for the change to return to your
wallet after every new channel opening.
</Callout>
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Opening channels">
Although LND features an optional "autopilot", we manually open some channels.

We recommend to go on [Amboss.Space](https://www.amboss.space) or
[1ML.com](https://1ml.com) and look for a mix of big and small nodes with decent
Node Ranks. Another great way to find peers to collaboratively set up channels
is [LightningNetwork+](https://lightningnetwork.plus).

To connect to a remote node, you need its URI that looks like `<pubkey>@host`:

* the `<pubkey>` is just a long hexadecimal number, like
`03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f`
* the `host` can be a domain name, an ip address or a Tor onion address,
followed by the port number (usually `:9735`)

Just grab the whole URI above the big QR code and use it as follows (we will use
the ACINQ node as an example):

* **Connect** to the remote node, with the full URI.

[`connect`](https://api.lightning.community/api/lnd/lightning/connect-peer)

```sh
lncli connect 03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f@34.239.230.56:9735
```

* **Open a channel** using the `<pubkey>` only (*i.e.*, the part of the URI
before the `@`) and the channel capacity in satoshis.

[`openchannel`](https://api.lightning.community/api/lnd/lightning/open-channel)

One Bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis. The command has a built-in fee
estimator, but to avoid overpaying fees, you can manually control the fees for
the funding transaction by using the `sat_per_vbyte` argument as follows (to
select the appropriate fee, in sats/vB, check
[mempool.space](https://mempool.space))

```sh
lncli openchannel --sat_per_vbyte 8 03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f 100000 0
```

* **Check your funds**, both in the on-chain wallet and the channel balances.

[`walletbalance`](https://api.lightning.community/api/lnd/lightning/wallet-balance)

```sh copy
lncli walletbalance
```

[`channelbalance`](https://api.lightning.community/api/lnd/lightning/channel-balance)

```sh copy
lncli channelbalance
```

* **List active channels**. Once the channel funding transaction has been mined
and gained enough confirmations, your channel is fully operational. That can
take an hour or more.

[`listchannels`](https://api.lightning.community/api/lnd/lightning/list-channels)

```sh copy
lncli listchannels
```

* **Make a Lightning payment**. By default, these work with invoices, so when
you buy something or want to send money, you need to get an invoice first.
However, you can also pay without requesting an invoice as long the receiving
node supports the keysend or amp feature!

To try, why not send me 21 satoshis! You simply need to input my node pukey
[`Stadicus node`](https://amboss.space/node/02acd93e3352fd59066ca3f23e8865de1926301e8be03c6a52f0f7e43533fe9888),
the amount in satoshis and add the --keysend flag.

```sh copy
lncli sendpayment --dest 02acd93e3352fd59066ca3f23e8865de1926301e8be03c6a52f0f7e43533fe9888 --amt 21 --keysend
```
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Adding watchtowers">
Lightning channels need to be monitored to prevent malicious behavior by your
channel peers. If your Microbolt goes down for a longer period of time, for
instance due to a hardware problem, a node on the other side of one of your
channels might try to close the channel with an earlier channel balance that is
better for them.

Watchtowers are other Lightning nodes that can monitor your channels for you. If
they detect such bad behavior, they can react on your behalf, and send a
punishing transaction to close this channel. In this case, all channel funds
will be sent to your LND on-chain wallet.

A watchtower can only send such a punishing transaction to your wallet, so you
don't have to trust them. It's good practice to add a few watchtowers, just to
be on the safe side.

* Add the [Lightning Network+
watchtower](https://lightningnetwork.plus/watchtower) as a first example

```sh copy
lncli wtclient add 023bad37e5795654cecc69b43599da8bd5789ac633c098253f60494bde602b60bf@iiu4epqzm6cydqhezueenccjlyzrqeruntlzbx47mlmdgfwgtrll66qd.onion:9911
```

* Check if the watchtower is active and list your towers

```sh copy
lncli wtclient towers
```

```output filename="output"
{
    "towers": [
        {
            "pubkey": "023bad37e5795654cecc69b43599da8bd5789ac633c098253f60494bde602b60bf",

Same as you can connect as a watchtower client to other watchtower servers, you
could give the same service running an altruist watchtower server. This was
previously activated in the `lnd.conf`, and you can see the information about it
by typing the following command and sharing it with your peers.

```sh copy
