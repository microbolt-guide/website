# Blockchain explorer

After the Microbolt runs your own fully validated node, and even acts as a
backend for your hardware signing device with Electrum server, an
important puzzle piece to improve privacy and financial sovereignty is your own
Blockchain Explorer.
It lets you query transactions, addresses, and blocks of your choice.
You no longer need to leak information by querying a third-party blockchain
explorer that can be used to get your location and cluster addresses.

Choose your explorer, when you're done jump to the Mining Pool section
