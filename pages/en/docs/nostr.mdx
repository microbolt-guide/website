## What is Nostr?

Nostr is a straightforward and open protocol for global, decentralized, and
censorship-resistant social media. It offers numerous advantages for users and
is completely free, requiring no ID or third-party verification to begin
connecting with like-minded individuals and expanding your community. While
nostr is sometimes confused as just another social media platform, it goes
beyond that. Explore the resources provided here to discover its significant
potential.

This protocol is based on relays. Relays are servers that can be operated by
anyone. By opening a persistent connection with the server, clients (or apps)
can push and pull events in real-time.

[Relays](https://usenostr.org/#relays) are the central element of the nostr
protocol, responsible for storing events received from clients.

Crucially, relays do not communicate with each other. Only the relays you're
connected to will receive and store your events. This is a key feature of nostr,
emphasizing the lack of communication between relays. Therefore, you should
connect to as many relays as you wish to share your data with.

Clients should always provide users the flexibility to connect to multiple
relays. Users can also decide whether they want to read, write, or do both with
the relays they're connected to. This means I can choose to connect to a
specific relay to access content without necessarily sharing my own events
there, or vice versa.
