# Bitcoin

The base of a sovereign Bitcoin node is a fully validating Bitcoin client.
It will download the whole blockchain and validate every single transaction that
ever happened. After this verification, the client can check the validity of all
future transactions.

Your Bitcoin client also acts as a data source for other applications, like the
Electrum server (to use with your software and hardware wallets), blockchain
explorer or Lightning client.

We first install Bitcoin Client and *crum on the node.
We then set up the powerful Sparrow desktop wallet on your computer and connect
it to your *crum server for secure and private base layer operations, such as
sending and receiving payments from and to your hardware wallet.
Finally, we install BTC RPC Explorer on the node, a lite blockchain explorer
with a clean web UI for privately checking your transactions and the mempool.
