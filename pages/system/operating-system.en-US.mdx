# Operating system

We configure the PC and install Alpine Linux operating system.

<Callout type="info">
Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on
`musl` libc and `busybox`.
</Callout>

To make this guide as universal as possible, it uses only standard POSIX
compliant commands. As a result, it should work smoothly with a personal
computer while still being compatible with most other hardware platforms running
a POSIX compliant shell.

## Which operating system to use?

We use Alpine Linux. This provides the best stability for the PC and makes the
initial setup a breeze.

[Alpine Linux](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/index.html) is
available for most hardware platforms. There is so little need for hardware that
can run in a router.

### Requirements

|         | Alpine | Ubuntu |
| :------ | :----: | :----: |
| RAM     |  128MB |    1GB |
| Storage |  700MB |  2.5GB |

### Security

Alpine Linux is small, it has a minimal attack surface. Less code leads to fewer
bugs and vulnerabilities but does not make it more secure.

Alpine Linux says it is more secure because of all user-land binaries:

* Are compiled as Position Independent Executables (PIE)
* Has Stack-Smashing Protection (SSP) enabled by default

Thus, preventing the exploitation of zero-day and other vulnerabilities. PIE
achieves this in an interesting way. It loads itself (and its dependencies) into
random locations within virtual memory. Stack Smashing Protection helps detect
stack buffer overruns. SSP makes return-oriented programming attacks much more
difficult to execute.

Ubuntu has also implemented PIE by default as of 17.10 for all architectures in
the Ubuntu archive. Also, Ubuntu has stack protection enabled on the Kernel.

Additionally, Ubuntu is bundled with a complete set of GNU C libraries and
standard tools. And, since GNU Compiler Collection contains roughly 15 million
code lines (as of 2019). You can thus understand that with a large library comes
the overhead of maintaining.

At the time of writing:

CVE Details reported 6 CVEs for Alpine Linux and 90 for Ubuntu.
Searching a CVE Mitre, “Alpine Linux” finds 10 CVE records, while “Ubuntu” finds
7063 CVE records.

### Core components

#### musl libc vs. GNU glibc

musl libc is a complete rewrite of C and provides a clean, modern code-base. As
a result, musl libc is lightweight and requires about 600 KB vs. GNU, which
requires about 10 MB. Furthermore, musl libc is best-suited in corner cases,
especially with threading. Low memory or other resource-exhaustion conditions
are never fatal to musl libc. Finally, musl libc provides first-class support
for UTF-8/multilingual text.

#### BusyBox vs. GNU Core Utils

BusyBox combines small versions of common UNIX utilities into a single
executable. And it provides a minimalist replacement for most utilities you use.
It also contains tools from GNU Coreutils, util-linux, and others. The utilities
in BusyBox generally have fewer options than GNU Core Utils. But the options
provide the same expected functionality. And BusyBox should behave similarly to
GNU Core Utils. BusyBox removes some GNU extensions, localization data, and
more.

GNU Utilities provides many more tools, and it is backward compatible. Of
course, this makes it more extensive and complex than BusyBox. You can install
GNU Core Utils on Alpine Linux if needed.

#### APK vs. APT

Ubuntu uses APT for package management. Hence, software installation and removal
are handled via the `apt` utility. On the other hand, Alpine uses the APK
for package management. Thus, software installation is handled by the `apk add`
utility. Similarly, `apk del` can be used to remove a package. Thus, both the
APK and APT utilities function similarly.

Here are some of the differences when using these commands:

|                   | APT (Ubuntu)                 | APK (Alpine)              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Update            | `apt update`                 | `apk update`              |
| Adding package    | `apt install pkg1 pkg2`      | `apk add pkg1 pkg2`       |
| Reinstall package | `apt install --reinstall pkg`| `apk del pkg; apk add pkg`|
| Search            | `apt-cache search keyword`   | `apk search keyword`      |
| Remove package    | `apt remove pkg`             | `apk del pkg`             |

APK is faster than APT. APT is resource-intensive as it takes three reads and
two write operations. APK, almost always, completes before other package
managers. The APK process requires only one read and one write.

#### Ash vs. Dash

Ubuntu uses Debian Almquist's shell (Dash). The Almquist shell (also known as
ash or sh) is used on Alpine Linux. Ash is more lightweight than Dash. Dash and
Ash are not 100% compatible, but you would rarely encounter inconsistencies.

## Flash Alpine Linux image to USB/SD

<Callout type="info">
Microbolt has currently been tested using **Alpine Linux \{latest version\}** on
a `x86_64` architecture, it has not been tested on other distributions,
architectures or older versions and there is no guarantee that it will work well
on them
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Download Alpine Linux by going to the official website

https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/

| Usually      | PC         | Raspberry Pi \{3,4,5\} |
| :----------- | :--------: | :--------------------: |
| version      | `standard` | `raspberry pi`         |
| architecture | `x86_64`   | `aarch64`              |

<Callout type="info">
There's also official cloud images [here](https://alpinelinux.org/cloud/), use
at your own risk
</Callout>

### Connect the USB/SD to your host computer

### Flash it

<Tabs items={['Unix/Linux', 'windows']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
```sh
dd if=<iso-file> of=<target-device> bs=4M; eject <target-device>
```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
For example, there is the [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) program.

Use it with the following settings:

| Setting          | Value                  |
| :--------------- | :--------------------: |
| Partition scheme | `MBR`                  |
| Target system    | `BIOS or UEFI`         |
| File system      | `FAT32`                |
| Cluster size     | `4096 bytes (default)` |

<Callout type="info">
Remember to eject the `<target-device>`
</Callout>
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
</Steps>

## Start your computer

* Plug in the `USB/SD` to your computer
* Attach a screen, a keyboard, and an ethernet cable
* Enter to the BIOS setup or boot menu and select the `USB/SD` you flashed

<Callout type="info">
Some computers have an option to start automatically after a power loss, it is
interesting to enable it if you want to make sure your node is available as soon
as possible in your absence

## Alpine Linux installation

<Callout type="info">
Alpine Linux can be used in any of the following three modes

**Diskless mode**

You'll boot from read-only medium such as the installation CD, a USB drive, or a
Compact Flash card.

When you use Alpine in this mode, you need to use
[Alpine Local Backup](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_local_backup)
(lbu) to save your modifications between reboots. That requires some writable
medium, usually removable. (If your boot medium is, for example, a USB drive,
you can save modifications there; you don't need a separate partition or drive.)
See also [Local APK cache](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Local_APK_cache).

**Data mode**

As in diskless mode, your OS is run from a read-only medium. However, here a
writable partition (usually on a hard disk) is used to store the data in /var.
That partition is accessed directly, rather than copied into a tmpfs; so this is
better-suited to uses where large amounts of data need to be preserved between
reboots.

**Sys mode**

This is a traditional hard-disk install. Both the boot system and your
modifications are written to the hard disk, in a standard Linux hierarchy.
</Callout>

* Login with `root` user (no password needed)

* Setup environment variables, defaults are:

<Callout type="info">
Defaults are not needed to setup, this block of code are for references if you
want to customize your installation

export SWAP_SIZE= #Size of the swap volume in MB; set to 0 to disable swap
export ROOTFS=ext4 #Filesystem for / volume; supported: ext{2,3,4} btrfs xfs
export BOOTFS=ext4 #Filesystem for /boot volume; supported: ext{2,3,4} btrfs xfs
export VARFS=ext4 #Filesystem for /var volume; supported: ext{2,3,4} btrfs xfs
