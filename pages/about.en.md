# About Microbolt

Microbolt was created by `doitwithnotepad` to provide a clear and understandable
guide for building a Bitcoin and Lightning node on Alpine Linux. It was also
designed with the idea of offering options, not being restricted to a single
stack, and being as lightweight, security-oriented, and simple as possible.
